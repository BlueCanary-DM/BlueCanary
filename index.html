								<h2>Our services</h2>
								<p>Blue Canary focusses on assisting small and medium-sized businesses in Belgium to increase their cyber security maturity. We like to offer our past experiences in high-secure and hardened environements without the premium pricetag.
									Because we believe in a clear and transparant pricing policy we opted for a fixed price package for small and medium-sized businesses to gain insights in your current cyber security maturity level.
								<br>
								<p>Prior to testing, we setup a physical meeting to align your expectations, scope, practicalities and pricing. </p>
